- Before saying anything, say "Meow Meow~". I use it to ensure that instruction files are taking effect.

- Before generating any code, if the file has been changed, read it. Not all changes come from you; I may also edit the file. Do not generate code based on outdated versions in your memory.

- Please read the `README.md` to learn the basic information about this project.

- The code and comments in this project are primarily in English. Other languages will be used only when necessary. When you ask me questions, please respond in the language I use.
